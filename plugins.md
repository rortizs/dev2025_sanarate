# Plugins for VSCODE 2025

This page informations from popular plugins in vscode.

## IA
Cline is the best vscode extension for AI assistance. What I like about it the most is it's plan-then-act mode. While it plans (in plan mode), it walks you through the steps showing what's possible and what's not. Once you agree with the approach, switch to the act mode wherein it implements that approach in your editor.

That's good because unlike other AI coding assistants, it gives you the time to think and then implement. It does not churn out code for you instantly â€” that's helpful if you want to implement an approach yourself before letting AI do it.

Not only that, it also shows the tokens and the usage cost, which for me is incredibly helpful to track how much I use each model.

Here's a little demo for you to see it yourself.

```bash

```

```bash
url = https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot
```


## 2. Filesize

Filesize is a simple extension which enables me to see the size of a file in VSCode's status bar. It's really handy if I want to see size of a build file (especially if I am dealing with javascript).

```bash
url = https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkxml.vscode-filesize
```

## 3. Better Comments #

Better Comments, as the name suggests, allows me to tag my comments and colorize them according to the type. For example, if you specify TODO: before a comment it will colorize it in yellow to indicate that this is pending. If a method is deprecated, I can use an exclamation mark to color it in red.

## 4. Code Spell Checker #

The use case of this extension is reduced after the advent of AI extensions, but I still keep it around in case I misspell a variable unknowingly. The part where it shines is detection of camelCase or any other coding case words because it splits the words and then spells check them.

```bash
url = https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
```

## 5. Git Graph #

Git Graph is one of those extensions which you definitely need of you don't want to pay for GitLens and other similar extensions. I use it because it's completely free and provides all of the useful insights about your git repo. It's a near perfect git extension.

## 6. Markdownlint #
I write blogs, and so markdownlint is a useful extension for me as I write my posts in markdown. It's a decent extension allowing me to properly structure content inside a markdown file.

```bash
url = https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint


## 7. Auto Rename Tag #
I only listed this extension to let you know that the functionality of Auto Rename Tag is now built in to VSCode. To turn on this feature, simply set the editor.linkedEditing key to true in your settings.json file.

```bash

url = https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag

```

## 8. SQL Tools #

I use SQL Tools (a database management extension) only when I don't want to go outside of my editor to query a database and to perform simple operations and lookups. It allows me to connect to a specific database from within my editor but keep in mind that you need to install driver extensions separately in order to connect to a database.

I don't recommend this extension for complex use cases. In that case, you can look for a standalone database management tool like pgAdmin or DBeaver.



## 8 Html and Css autocomplitions

HTML to CSS completion suggestions
Default settings are set to html/php >> css/scss/less/sass/stylus flow.
To change file types you want to get selectors from use HTML to CSS autocompletion extension configuration from command palette or VSCode user settings.
